# THIS IS META

[THIS IS META LIVE!](https://lijasontse.github.io/THIS-IS-META/#weapon-5)

THIS IS META is a data visualization project on a single web page created using Vanilla JavsScript, HTML, CSS, D3.js library and the Intersection Observer API.

THIS IS META displays the data of the current meta weapons of the battle royale game called Call of Duty: Warzone.

I, myself, have really enjoyed playing this game since its launch back in March 2020. Over the course of playing the game, I found that a lot of my friends were always asking me what weapons they should be using and with which attachments. I was always up to date with the best weapons to use in the game, and for a controller player, it makes the experience night and day. 

Thus, THIS IS META is here to show users which weapons are good or the meta, currently. Users can also interact with the page to see the change in the statistics via the graph generated using the D3.js API for the meta weapons with or without the meta attachments.
