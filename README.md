# THIS IS META

THIS IS META is a data visualization project on a single web page created using Vanilla JavsScript, HTML, CSS, D3.js library and the Intersection Observer API.

THIS IS META displays the data of the current meta weapons of the battle royale game called Call of Duty: Warzone. With the recent integration of two very different games, the Warzone meta is always changing. Streamers and pro-gamers are using weapons that regular gamers never seen before. Thus, THIS IS META is here to show users which weapons are good currently and also can interact with the page to see the statistics change in the bar graph if they had all of the best attachments for the weapons attached.
