# THIS IS META

# Background

THIS IS META is a data visualization project on a single web page created using Vanilla JavsScript, HTML, CSS, D3.js library and the Intersection Observer API. THIS IS META displays the data of the current meta weapons of the battle royale game, Call of Duty: Warzone.

I, myself, have really enjoyed playing this game since its launch back in March 2020. Over the course of playing the game, I found that a lot of my friends were always asking me what weapons they should be using and with which attachments. I was always up to date with the best weapons to use in the game, and for a controller player, it makes the experience night and day. Thus, THIS IS META is here to show users which weapons are good or the meta, currently.

# Functionality & MVP

Users of the THIS IS META data visualizer are able to:

* Scroll through the list of the current meta weapons (12 total)
* Click on drop down list and it will show the best attachments to use for the weapon
* Toggle through the visualization with the navigation icons on the right side 
* View and hover over statistics rendered on the bar chart
